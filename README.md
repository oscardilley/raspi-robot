# Oscar Dilley raspi-robot

The aim of this project is to produce a raspberry pi robot with all code
held on git. It will use the L293D motor control chip and 2 HC-SR04 
ultrasound sensors to give a live displacement measurement (averaged) to 
the closest object infront. The device will be controlled over wifi on a 
VNC connection and show a the live preview of what the mounted RPi 
camera sees.
